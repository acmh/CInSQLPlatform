# CInSQLPlatform
Web-based plataform to increase SQL study experience

# *Motivation and Overview *#


ZooSQL is a nice web plataform to traing SQL Skills. At CIn - UFPE (Centro de Inform√°tica) there is a discipline to the students learn everything about databases and special-purpose languages like SQL to manage them. In this context, My idea is create a web-plataform like SQLZoo to assist teachers, teachers assistants and students to improve the study experience on SQL and databases in that discipline.

In this plataform you can create list of questions to students can solve and so on.
